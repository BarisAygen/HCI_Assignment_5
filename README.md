# HCI_Assignment_5

Folders:


gestures -> Images for left panel gesture image display
images -> Images for app gallery

Main code files required where GUI and gesture implementations are combined for a fully functional application:
gestures.py
utils.py
mediaPipeHandler.py
image_gallery_app.py

Extra files to show progress:
image_gallery_app_only_gui.py -> The GUI file for the app
mediapipe_gesture_implementation.ipynb -> The gesture implementation file for the GUI


In this project, the MediaPipe library is used to create an interactive system that uses hand gesture recognition. Some hand position landmarks are used to generate the gestures. A live stream from the camera on the computer is used to identify the movements. The gestures trigger the buttons on the graphical user interface. Users can perform their chosen actions using hand gestures. This is an image gallery application where users use hand gestures to perform certain functions of the application.
